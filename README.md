Torn PDA has been developed as an assistant for players of [TORN City](https://www.torn.com). 

It was conceived to enhance the experience of playing Torn from a mobile platform, and other already existing applications, such as YATA, have been a great influence.

* Check your travel status and configure notifications just before you arrive. No more forgetting and being mugged abroad. Also, configure the notification shown so that it is safe to use even at work or in other public environments.

* Follow your faction's chain live from the app, with instant energy updates.

* Create your own target list, adding your own comments and many other details. Chaining has never been easier.

* Have a look at your last few attacks, with simple statistics so that you can decide when/who to add to your common chaining targets.

* Export targets as a backup or share them with other players

* Dark Mode
